# barcode_sheet
This is a simple script to create a sheet with all product barcodes for a list of products

This would be for a small cafe or shop where not all products have a barcode printed on them.

Call only create_barcode function if you wish to only create a single png image with a barcode

Call arrange_barcodes to add a name to the barcode image, using the filename as the name of the product

arrange_one_page will place all .png files that have been created by the previous functions onto a single page or multiple if applicable
